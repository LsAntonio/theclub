We have a lot of updates news today! 

**First**, there is channel now on Challenge Course Slack. (those who are not a part of the challenge course, ignore the channel part).

**Second**, detailed answers to the quiz will be published tomorrow! 

**Third**, there is a repo now for our first paper - feel free to add your implementations (or links to your implementations) there. Please read the [implementation guidelines](https://github.com/papersdclub/theclub/blob/master/implementation_guidelines.md) first. And there is already one implementation by @shivu!

**And finally** Tomorrow we will start the new round of voting for the next paper! Time to move on from PCA! Add your proposals to Paper Proposals sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w5gMKcwRyFKW_3JVB6kEZ6uVT_fHtrrDHxCy5kU0MV8/edit#gid=1091439268)

### Update 2 

There are 42 (forty two) members now (as per Google Doc) and it's getting hard to manage it all. Hence, I asked **Dharmendra** (@Dharmendra Choudhary) and **Marce** (@Marce) for help. They will help with posting the updates and managing other important issues. They are already doing that on Slack! But there are more great things to come! ;)

Also, I was told that a lot of members were struggling with the math part. Initially, I planned the club for those with maths and CS background, but eventually more and more people got interested, so this requirement was kind of removed. What's done is done and everyone is welcome! However, there are some ideas on how to adress this issue. Look for updates!

### Update 1

The first deadline has passed! Only a few people were able to complete the paper and the quiz by the deadline. Also, based on data, I suspect that some of them tried the quiz before completed the paper - otherwise, I can't explain the answers selected for some of the questions. :) I have initiated discussion in the #general channel, so you can join or start your own - just make sure to prepend it with the keyword **papers_dclub**!

## June, 17, 2019

And our first quiz is up and running! 
The link: [**QUIZ**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RV3SDRC)

**It has been tested for sanity by two of our dear members: Dharmendra and Marce. Thank you, guys!** 

Important things about this quiz:  
1. I will not see your individual answers, only the overall stats, so feel free to make mistakes. :)
2. The quiz covers general concepts, not any specific parts of derivations. It should be accessible for all members!  

I will publish the overall stats after all deadlines and maybe some intermediate results if I have enough data. Again - these are aggregate stats, no individual results are seen to anyone. But please avoid taking the quiz without reading the paper (or at least skimming through it).

Also, after you complete it, please take a survey so that we know how to proceed further: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RPTKD9L

-- Cheers, Ana

### Update 3
If you have completed reading the first paper (or decided not to complete it at all), plese take a survey (it's very important for future activities): https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RPTKD9L

### Update 2
The quiz is ready and the link to it will be published here and in #general channel tomorrow. The goal of the quiz is to enhance the paper reading experience. It's not a competition. :) The quiz will be tested by two of our members before I publish it (Marce and Dharmendra). Also, for those who will make it to the implementation stage, Dharmendra will create a quiz that covers practical aspectes of PCA. I saw a few questions - they are great!

### Update 1
The deadline for the reading is tomorrow and I hope most of you will have completed it by that time. But if not - it's still okay (it's soft deadline). There are two more activities we can perform in addition to discussion, which are: 
1. Paper summary. It would be good if somone can write a summary.
2. Poll-quiz on surveymonkey that will help us to understand what was the hardest part of the paper. 

PS. Sorry for not updating for a few days. My life has just changed completely. For good. I was too happy. :)

Marce (Slack: Marce) suggested that we use ReviewNB in our implementations. In short: it allows to review changes (diff) in notebooks in a human-readable way (not JSON diffs!), which is quite cool. I have already installed this plugin for our organisation, and Marce will come up with more info/tutorials soon! :)

-- Cheers, Ana 

## June, 11, 2019

We have created an organisation for the club - [https://github.com/papersdclub](https://github.com/papersdclub)! This will contain implementations as well as organisational notes, reading lists and other
useful things. If you haven't done it already - request to join. Alternatively, send me a message on Slack or add you github in the GoogleDoc with members! More updates will follow in the nearest future! :) 

-- Cheers, Ana

## June, 10, 2019

We've asked for the estimates for the time needed to complete reading. Most of of the club members are confident they will be able to complete reading in one week. Some respondents estimated their reading time to be 2 weeks. Don't worry, guys, we'll wait for you! :) 

-- Cheers, Ana


## June, 8, 2019 

We have selected the first paper for reading. And the winner is ["A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1100.pdf).
The paper was selected after running a survey. It turned out that most people were interested in introductory papers. And, actually, there were two winners: the current paper and word2vec. The next survey will include the newly proposed papers. 

-- Cheers, Ana
