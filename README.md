## June, 22, 2019

### Update 2

The survey is over and we have a winner - [**Differentially Private Federated Learning: A Client Level Perspective**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07557.pdf). In fact, it was a tie: Neural Turing Machine, word2vec and the winning paper all got almost equal number of votes. But since the challenge course is on privacy and federated learning is one of its topics, we decided that we should read this paper anyway if it gets enough voices. The new deadlines will be added tomorrow, but expect to have 2 weeks to complete the full cycle. 

Update for Slack users of Secure and Private AI scholarship challenge: me, Marce and Dharmendra are now the moderators of #reading_paper_discuss channel! There are still more than two months ahead and I hope it will be a great journey!

-- Cheers, Ana & Marce

### Update 1

Hey everyone! After running a survey we discovered that majority of people WOULD LOVE to have **live discussion**. And there are great news for them! This Sunday (as most of you selected Saturday and Sunday as preferred day) there will be live session to discuss the paper we’ve just completed (A Tutorial on PCA). **The session will be hosted by @shivu** who completed all the stages (read -> quiz -> implement). This is a great time to discuss the toughest parts as well as practical applications. This is NOT ama, it’s discussion. @shivu and @Marce will be moderating the discussion, but they are not teachers, so prepare for the discussion, not recitation! Also, **if there are other people who completed the full cycle (or at least reading and quiz), they can co-host the session if they wish** - please message one of us (me, @Marce, @shivu or @Dharmendra Choudhary). Happy learning!

-- Cheers, Ana

Marce is running a survey to select our next paper. Please take the [SURVEY](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YRZB6CP). We're also planning live discussion on Sunday that will be lead by one of the members. 

If you're still reading the paper and planning to take the quiz - **don't panic!** I will not close the quiz. The deadline is for self-control to make sure we're pretty much on the same page. But I will like the quiz open, so that newcomers can take it with their own pace. 

-- Cheers, Ana

## June, 20, 2019

### Update 2

As promised, the quiz solutions are out! Please do not read before taking the quiz. It's important to think about the question before knowing the answer. ;)

[Solutions](https://github.com/papersdclub/a_tutorial_on_pca/blob/master/quiz_solutions.md)

### Update 1
The hard deadline for the paper has passed and the hard deadline for the quiz is tomorrow. What it means is that we will be moving to the next stage. It's time to select another paper and time to discuss what we've learnt. Also, it would be great if some of you will ry implementaton (see [implementation guidelines](https://github.com/papersdclub/theclub/blob/master/implementation_guidelines.md)). 

Don't forget to vote, when the survey for the next paper is out, so that you don't ask me "Why are we reading this?" You know what I want to read, but we have democracy here, so voting decided it all. :)

-- Cheers, Ana 

## June, 19, 2019

We have a lot of updates news today! 

**First**, there is channel now on Challenge Course Slack. (those who are not a part of the challenge course, ignore the channel part).

**Second**, detailed answers to the quiz will be published tomorrow! 

**Third**, there is a repo now for our first paper - feel free to add your implementations (or links to your implementations) there. Please read the [implementation guidelines](https://github.com/papersdclub/theclub/blob/master/implementation_guidelines.md) first. And there is already one implementation by @shivu!

**And finally** Tomorrow we will start the new round of voting for the next paper! Time to move on from PCA! Add your proposals to Paper Proposals sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w5gMKcwRyFKW_3JVB6kEZ6uVT_fHtrrDHxCy5kU0MV8/edit#gid=1091439268)

### Update 2 

There are 42 (forty two) members now (as per Google Doc) and it's getting hard to manage it all. Hence, I asked **Dharmendra** (@Dharmendra Choudhary) and **Marce** (@Marce) for help. They will help with posting the updates and managing other important issues. They are already doing that on Slack! But there are more great things to come! ;)

Also, I was told that a lot of members were struggling with the math part. Initially, I planned the club for those with maths and CS background, but eventually more and more people got interested, so this requirement was kind of removed. What's done is done and everyone is welcome! However, there are some ideas on how to adress this issue. Look for updates!

### Update 1

The first deadline has passed! Only a few people were able to complete the paper and the quiz by the deadline. Also, based on data, I suspect that some of them tried the quiz before completed the paper - otherwise, I can't explain the answers selected for some of the questions. :) I have initiated discussion in the #general channel, so you can join or start your own - just make sure to prepend it with the keyword **papers_dclub**!

![Intermediate results](https://github.com/papersdclub/theclub/blob/master/images/results_1.jpeg)

## June, 17, 2019

And our first quiz is up and running! 
The link: [**QUIZ**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RV3SDRC)

**It has been tested for sanity by two of our dear members: Dharmendra and Marce. Thank you, guys!** 

Important things about this quiz:  
1. I will not see your individual answers, only the overall stats, so feel free to make mistakes. :)
2. The quiz covers general concepts, not any specific parts of derivations. It should be accessible for all members!  

I will publish the overall stats after all deadlines and maybe some intermediate results if I have enough data. Again - these are aggregate stats, no individual results are seen to anyone. But please avoid taking the quiz without reading the paper (or at least skimming through it).

Also, after you complete it, please take a survey so that we know how to proceed further: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RPTKD9L

-- Cheers, Ana 

## June, 16, 2019

### Update 3
If you have completed reading the first paper (or decided not to complete it at all), plese take a survey (it's very important for future activities): https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RPTKD9L

### Update 2
The quiz is ready and the link to it will be published here and in #general channel tomorrow. The goal of the quiz is to enhance the paper reading experience. It's not a competition. :) The quiz will be tested by two of our members before I publish it (Marce and Dharmendra). Also, for those who will make it to the implementation stage, Dharmendra will create a quiz that covers practical aspectes of PCA. I saw a few questions - they are great!

### Update 1
The deadline for the reading is tomorrow and I hope most of you will have completed it by that time. But if not - it's still okay (it's soft deadline). There are two more activities we can perform in addition to discussion, which are: 
1. Paper summary. It would be good if somone can write a summary.
2. Poll-quiz on surveymonkey that will help us to understand what was the hardest part of the paper. 

PS. Sorry for not updating for a few days. My life has just changed completely. For good. I was too happy. :) 

-- Cheers, Ana

## June, 12, 2019

Marce (Slack: Marce) suggested that we use ReviewNB in our implementations. In short: it allows to review changes (diff) in notebooks in a human-readable way (not JSON diffs!), which is quite cool. I have already installed this plugin for our organisation, and Marce will come up with more info/tutorials soon! :)

-- Cheers, Ana 

## June, 11, 2019

We have created an organisation for the club - [https://github.com/papersdclub](https://github.com/papersdclub)! This will contain implementations as well as organisational notes, reading lists and other
useful things. If you haven't done it already - request to join. Alternatively, send me a message on Slack or add you github in the GoogleDoc with members! More updates will follow in the nearest future! :) 

-- Cheers, Ana

## June, 10, 2019

We've asked for the estimates for the time needed to complete reading. Most of of the club members are confident they will be able to complete reading in one week. Some respondents estimated their reading time to be 2 weeks. Don't worry, guys, we'll wait for you! :) 

-- Cheers, Ana


## June, 8, 2019 

We have selected the first paper for reading. And the winner is ["A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1100.pdf).
The paper was selected after running a survey. It turned out that most people were interested in introductory papers. And, actually, there were two winners: the current paper and word2vec. The next survey will include the newly proposed papers. 

-- Cheers, Ana
