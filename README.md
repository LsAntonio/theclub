The deadline for the reading is tomorrow and I hope most of you will have completed it by that time. But if not - it's still okay (it's soft deadline). There are two more activities we can perform in addition to discussion, which are: 
1. Paper summary. It would be good if somone can write a summary.
2. Poll-quiz on surveymonkey that will help us to understand what was the hardest part of the paper. 

PS. Sorry for not updating for a few days. My life has just changed completely. For good. I was too happy. :)

Marce (Slack: Marce) suggested that we use ReviewNB in our implementations. In short: it allows to review changes (diff) in notebooks in a human-readable way (not JSON diffs!), which is quite cool. I have already installed this plugin for our organisation, and Marce will come up with more info/tutorials soon! :)

We have created an organisation for the club - [https://github.com/papersdclub](https://github.com/papersdclub)! This will contain implementations as well as organisational notes, reading lists and other
useful things. If you haven't done it already - request to join. Alternatively, send me a message on Slack or add you github in the GoogleDoc with members! More updates will follow in the nearest future! :)

We've asked for the estimates for the time needed to complete reading. Most of of the club members are confident they will be able to complete reading in one week. Some respondents estimated their reading time to be 2 weeks. Don't worry, guys, we'll wait for you! :)

We have selected the first paper for reading. And the winner is ["A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1100.pdf).
The paper was selected after running a survey. It turned out that most people were interested in introductory papers. And, actually, there were two winners: the current paper and word2vec. The next survey will include the newly proposed papers.
