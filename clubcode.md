# Club Policy

## Our Goal

Our goal is to learn to read research papers. We're all AI/ML enthusiasts, who would like to become researchers one day!

## Who can join 

This discussion club is for beginners in research. Hence, you don't need any experience in reading papers. That said, 
it's highly recommended to have maths/CS background! I hope that later we will update this repository with lists of recommended courses/books and topics one must know. 

## The rules
