# Club Policy

## Our Goal

Our goal is to learn to read research papers. We're all AI/ML enthusiasts, who would like to become researchers one day!

## Who can join?

This discussion club is for beginners in research. Hence, you don't need any experience in reading papers. That said, 
it's highly recommended to have maths/CS background! I hope that later we will update this repository with lists of recommended courses/books and topics one must know. 

## How does it work? 
(draft) 

**Do**
1. Phase 1:
  - Step 1. We select a paper from our pool of proposals, using SurveyMonkey
  - Step 2. We estimate a deadline when all the member can complete the reading (SurveyMonkey)
  - Step 3. We read the paper 
2. Phase 2:
  - Step 1: We write a summary of the paper 
  - Step 2: We discuss the hard parts 
  - Step 3: We decided if we want to implement it (SurveyMonkey)
3. Phase 3 (optional)
  - Implement 

**While NOT(researcher)**
