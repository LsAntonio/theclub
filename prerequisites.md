# Pre-requisites 

The idea of this page is to create a road-map for beginners. We all have very differnt backgrounds - there are beginners and there are experienced practicioners. It would be great if we can 
create a structured curriculum for our field. 

**One constraint**, though [**IMPORTANT**]: **DO NOT add redundant resources**. 

Example: if we need statistics, **let it be ONE course**. It's ok to add a book. Some prefer reading to watching lectures. 
But please avoid adding courses. The thing  is that pretty much any course is good if you take it until it contains 
all the necessary topics. Also, one can always google to find another source. The goal of this page
is to work out a structured curriculum, not to gather all possible resources. There is a resources page for that. 
That said: please leave this paragraph at the top of the file and feel free to work on the curriculum! :) 
It's okay to replace the resource if you're confident your resource is better.
