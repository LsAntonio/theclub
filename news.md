We have created an organisation for the club! This will contain implementations as well as organisational notes, reading lists and other
useful things. If you haven't done it already - request to join. Alternatively, send me a message on Slack or add you github in the GoogleDoc with members!

We've asked for the estimates for the time needed to complete reading. Most of of the club members are confident they will be able to complete reading in one week. Some respondents estimated their readint time to be 2 weeks. Don't worry, guys, we'll wait for you! :)

We have selected the first paper for reading. And the winner is ["A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1100.pdf).
The paper was selected after running a survey. It turned out that most people were interested in introductory papers. And, actually, there were two winners: the current paper and word2vec. The next survey will include the newly proposed papers.
